class RecursiveFeatureEliminationCV:
    """
    Recursive feature elimination, using cross-validation to select the best set of features:
    In each step, the model is first evaluated using cross-validation.
    Then the feature importance values are aggregated across the models that were trained during cross-validation,
    and the least important feature is discarded. For the case where the lowest feature importance is 0, all
    features with 0 importance are discarded.
    This process is repeated until a point is reached where only `minFeatures` (or less) remain.
    The selected set of features is the one from the step where cross-validation yielded the best evaluation metric value.

    Feature importance is computed at the level of model input features, i.e. after feature generation and transformation.

    NOTE: This implementation differs markedly from sklearn's RFECV, which performs an independent RFE for each fold.
    RFECV determines the number of features to use by determining the elimination step in each fold that yielded the best
    metric value on average. Because the eliminations are independent, the actual features that were being used in those step
    could have been completely different. Using the selected number of features n, RFECV then performs another RFE, eliminating features
    until n features remain and returns these features as the result.
